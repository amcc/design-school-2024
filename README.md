# ðŸ§¨Design School 2024

## ðŸš€ a set of interactive ideas for the Design School Showcase.
This repo contains web based code, experimenting with different technology. 

Folders are structured by tecnology and then by the code system used. For instance:
- machine learning
  - ml5js
    - getting started
    - demos
  - mediapipe
    - getting started
    - demos

 Machine Learning is the tecnology used to do most AI stuff these days. ml5js amd MediaPipe are 2 leading ways of using machine learning to play on the web.

 We are interested in body tracking, this is called pose detection, or pose landmark detection. Both *ml5js* and *mediaPipe* have code examples on doing body tracking on the web. 
 *ml5js* has *p5js* examples so is easier to learn, however *mediaPipe* is better! The code isn't much different.
